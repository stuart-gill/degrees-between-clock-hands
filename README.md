# Degrees between clock hands -- Stuart Gill

## Description

This app that determines the distance in degrees between the minute and hour hands on an analog clock, at a given time. It should use a Clock class with a method to take a time of day as input, and return the number of degrees for output. For example, 12 o'clock would return 0ยบ and 6 o'clock would return 180ยบ. Always return the smaller distance and be as precise as possible.

## Behavior-driven Development

| Specs    |  Input | Expected Output    
| ------------- |------------- |:-------------:|
| The program should return 0 degree for all 12 cases where the locations of the hour and the minute hands are the same.| 3:15 | 0
| The program should return the degrees between the hands for all hours.| 4:25 | 30
